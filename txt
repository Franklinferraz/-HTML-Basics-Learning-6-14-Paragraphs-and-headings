Paragraphs and headings

We're definitely making good progress! 
We've learned when and why we use HTML. 
We've also learned how to:

a. Set up an HTML file with tags
b. Title the webpage (in the <head>)
c. Create paragraphs (in the <body> with <p> tags)

The next step is to give our paragraphs headings using heading tags. 
Let's start with the <h1> tag. The content between this tag will be the biggest!

Instructions
In the body section, create a heading.
To do this, create an <h1> tag.
Add content.
Close the element with a closing tag </h1>. 
(Your content should now be between <h1> and </h1>.)
Underneath the heading tags, create two paragraphs using <p> tags with whatever content you like.

Hint
Remember: paragraphs require <p></p> tags!
